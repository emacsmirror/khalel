#+TITLE: =khalel= changelog and news

Below are the summarized changes made in each version:

* v0.1.11
- Fixes error "Tab width in Org files must be 8, not X" if =tab-width= is set to
  anything but a value of =8=.
- Fixes parsing of calendar names with space inside (e.g. "My Calendar").
* v0.1.10
- Introduces work-around for bug in =org-element-cache-map= when capturing
  multiple events via sub-trees.
- Fixes bug in =khalel= when finishing capture of events containing sub-headings.
* v0.1.9
- Import support for iCalendar invitations in =gnus= and =mu4e= mail views.
- If no default calendar is specified on import, =khalel= will offer a prompt to
  pick one. The new default value for ~khalel-default-calendar~ is now =nil= and
  therefore the prompt.
- Fixes handling of  =khalel-khal-config=, see [[https://gitlab.com/hperrey/khalel/-/issues/9][issue #9]].
* v0.1.8
- Allow to include past events in the import date range:
  - Modify the range by setting new variables ~khalel-import-start-date~ and
    ~khalel-import-end-date~ which support the same format as ~org-read-date~.
  - The previous date range variable ~khalel-import-time-delta~ has been
    deprecated.
  - As not only /upcoming/ events are supported, the following functions and
    variables have been renamed and their previous aliases marked deprecated:
    - ~khalel-import-upcoming-events~ → ~khalel-import-events~
    - ~khalel-update-upcoming-events-after-capture~ → ~khalel-import-events-after-capture~
- Ignore temporary capture files when storing org id locations.
* v0.1.7
- Adds variable for =khal= configuration file location: =khalel-khal-config=.
  The default is =nil= which uses =khal='s default location.
- Adds configurable format for import of events: =khal-import-format=.
- It is now possible to limit the import of events to only the default calendar
  by calling =khal-import-upcoming-events= with a prefix argument.
- The header of the org file with imported events can be changed through the
  variable =khalel-import-org-file-header=.
- Allows editing events scheduled in the past.
* v0.1.6
- Improves error handling on import and capture.
- Add (rudimentary) verification of ics export results.
- Adds auto-update of upcoming events on capture:
  - can be disabled via =khalel-update-upcoming-events-after-capture=
- Improves handling of temporary buffers during capture:
  - no switching to temporary buffer except in case of error
  - kill temporary buffer after capture when successful or aborted
- extends README with troubleshooting section.
* v0.1.5

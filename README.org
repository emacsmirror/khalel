#+TITLE: khalel

=khalel=: Interacting through Emacs with locally-stored calendars via the
console application =khal= and syncing with remote CalDAV calendars using
=vdirsyncer=.

=khalel= allows to access calendars stored in =.ics= files and provides means of
listing existing events, edit them as well as to create new ones largely through
an org-mode interface.

/Please note/: This code is in an early state. =khalel= shares limitations of
=khal= especially when it comes to calendar entry fields that are not handled at
the moment by either =khalel=, =khal= or org-mode's =.ics= exporter. Simple
scheduling of events works fine but do not expect features found in more complex
PIM applications such as invitees or even time zone support.

On the other hand, it is all text files, so hack away! :)

* Why =khal= and =khalel=
=khal= is a simple and fast way to read, create and edit calendar entries. It
does, however, have a limited feature set. If you need to deal with many shared
calendars and want to edit events with invited participants, this might not be
the right tool. If you have a simple CalDAV calendar for your own needs /or/
just want to see calendar events pop up in the org-mode agenda in Emacs, then
read ahead. Also check out =khal='s [[https://khal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#features][features and limitations in its online
documentation]] and the additional list of limitations below.

Adjusting the output of =khal=, one can quite easily get something that already resembles an
org-mode file (link to the online documentation: [[https://khal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html][khal usuage]]):

#+begin_src bash :results output
khal list --format "* {title} \n <{start-date} {start-time}-{end-time}> \n {location} \n {description}" --day-format "" today 10d
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

This is showing the events in the coming 10 days from now. This gives us
something to work with and means we don't have to touch the =.ics= files
directly. =khalel= takes this a step further and imports a configurable range of
events into a nicely-formated org-mode file.

Furthermore, =khalel= provides a wrapper around =khal= and =org-mode= export
functionality to create new events via org-mode capture templates. Even editing
existing events is possible through a console-interface to =khal=.

* Use case

I sync my remote CalDAV calendars using [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer][vdirsyncer]] which mirrors all events from
my locally. This calendar store can be accessed through =khal= and =khalel=. I
am mostly interested in seeing upcoming events in the org-mode agenda and to
quickly create new events with the familiar org-capture mechanism.

This requires a small chain of steps: most notably, in my setup, events created
through =khalel= require an additional import step to be visible in org-mode.

#+RESULTS:
[[file:sync_scheme.png]]

Of course, the synchronization and update of the imported org-file can be done
in one go! In fact, within the org-file, clickable links allow to either edit a
given event or sync & update all -- of course, without ever leaving Emacs!

** Features and limitations

Advantages with the approach:
- integrates neatly into my personal, Emacs-centric work-flow relying heavily on org-mode
- easy to customize with some elisp
- local calendar stores can easily be backed up (or even edited)
- synchronization can be done manually (when online) or automatized via cron job
  or from within Emacs

Disadvantages:
- several steps requiring different tools
- more initial set-up work
- currently, many features of =.ics=/CalDAV are not supported:
  - no timezones
  - no organizers/invitees
  - ...
- code in early state, use at own risk!

Besides calendars, this setup can be extended to contacts using:
- [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer][vdirsyncer]] (again) to mirror contacts from CardDAV server locally,
- [[https://github.com/scheibler/khard][khard]] to access them via the command line, and
- [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/khardel][khardel]] for integration into Emacs (not by me).

* Getting started
** Installing and configuring =vdirsyncer=
Follow the installation instructions at [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer]].

The configuration is explained in detail in the [[http://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/config.html#][online manual]] including a
[[http://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/tutorial.html][tutorial and minimal example]].

When done with the configuration, run =vdirsyncer discover= to test the setup
and then =vdirsyncer sync= to run the synchronization for the first time.

** Installing and configuring =khal=

Simply download the package for your preferred distribution or [[https://khal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html][follow the
installation instructions]].

You can create a configuration interactively by running =khal configure= or
simply use the one below and save it to =~/.config/khal/config=:

#+begin_src conf
[calendars]

[[my_calendar_local]]
path = ~/.calendar/*
type = discover

[locale]
timeformat = %H:%M
dateformat = %Y-%m-%d
longdateformat = %Y-%m-%d %a
datetimeformat = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M
longdatetimeformat = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M
#+end_src

Make sure that the =longdateformat= includes the day of the week in short form
(=%a=) as this makes sure that org-mode recognizes the time stamps correctly
when importing. You can test the settings by running
#+begin_src bash :results output
khal printformats
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: longdatetimeformat: 2013-12-21 21:45
: datetimeformat: 2013-12-21 21:45
: longdateformat: 2013-12-21 lör
: dateformat: 2013-12-21
: timeformat: 21:45

The weekday's short form will appear in your configured local language.

You might want to set up a default calendar as well or do that in the =khalel= configuration step below.

** Install =khalel=
The source code can be found at [[https://gitlab.com/hperrey/khalel]]

** Configuring =khalel=
First, make sure that the right =khal= and =vdirsyncer= executables will be used, e.g.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq khalel-khal-command "~/.local/bin/khal")
(setq khalel-vdirsyncer-command "vdirsyncer")
#+end_src

You might want to customize the values for default calendar, capture template key and import file for khalel:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq khalel-default-calendar "privat")
(setq khalel-capture-key "e")
(setq khalel-import-org-file (concat org-directory "calendar.org"))
#+end_src

 =calendar.org= is also in my list of agenda files. There the new events will end up in after the next sync.

*Warning*: =calendar.org= is being overwritten on each import to avoid collecting duplicates inside the file! The default is therefore to set the file up in read-only mode. The confirmation prompt for overwriting the file can be disabled via:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq khalel-import-org-file-confirm-overwrite nil)
#+end_src

And I never plan too long into the future, so the next 30 days will be more than enough to fill my agenda view:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq khalel-import-time-delta "30d")
#+end_src

Using these settings, we can now set up a capture template using a helper routine:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(khalel-add-capture-template)
#+end_src
Put this into your Emacs configuration file. The above command will also register an export hook that is run when the capture is finalized to trigger the export to =khal=.

** First steps
You can import upcoming events through =khalel-import-upcoming-events= or create
new ones through =org-capture= and pressing =e= (default key) for a new calendar
event.

You might want to consider adding the org file with the imported events
(=calendar.org= in the above example) to your org agenda.

If you visit the org file with the imported events, you will notice links below
each event: using these (or by calling =khalel-edit-calendar-event=) you can
edit existing events through =khal= from within Emacs.

To synchronize new, edited or remote events use either the links in the imported
calendar org file or call =khalel-run-vdirsyncer=.
